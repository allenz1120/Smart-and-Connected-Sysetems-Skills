## Summary
For this skill, I chose no-ip.com to get a free host (rettopyrrah.ddns.net) and set the IP target to the external IP of my home router. Then, I port forwarded port 3000 to my Raspberry Pi from my home router, which is the port I am running my Hello World http server from. Now, I am able to connect to my http server and see "Hello World" from anywhere in the world, as shown below.
