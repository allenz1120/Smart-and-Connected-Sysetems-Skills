# Code Readme

This program was built off of skill 30 because we needed the wheels to spin for the decoder. We then create the speedCalc and opticalData tasks. The optialData task increments a counter variable based on the optical encoder readings. The speedCalc takes a reading every 100ms and uses (counter * (2 * 3.14159 * 7 / 6)) / 100 to calculate the m/s of the crawler.
