# Code Readme

This code was adopted from the ADC1 example code that was given to us. We chose this as the starting point because it was configured to read raw and voltage data from the ADC pin already. We did change the attenuation to ADC_ATTEN_DB_11 since it would then be able to handle higher voltages closer to 3V. Once the voltage is read on line 338, we use the division and modulo operator to separate each digit of the voltage read. We then copied over the code from our previous alphanumeric display skill to have the reading display using the ADAfruit backpack. The code is located in the main folder.
