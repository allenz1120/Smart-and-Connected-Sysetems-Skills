This code was adopted from the i2c-display code example from the provided
github. We chose to use this as a base since it had preconfigured code for
using the i2c ports and displaying characters on the LED board. I used a
list of all the binary equivalents of ascii characters that I found on the 
ADA fruit backpack github (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LED_Backpack)
to index which letters correspond to which sequence of lights on the LED 
board.The main code in the in main folder.
