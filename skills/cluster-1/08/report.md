## Summary
This program satisties the tasks in the skill. It is able to
ask the user for an input of 4 characters which will then display
on the LED board after they hit enter. It uses the ADAfruit Led Backpack
github to convert characters from the I/O into the correct sequence of LED
segments to turn on. The user is then able to continuously change the display
in the monitor.
