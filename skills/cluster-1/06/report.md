## Summary
This program completes all the tasks in skill 6. This code was modified 
using the Blink.c file as a starting base due to it's existing configuation 
for flashing the LED on the ESP board. We also borrowed a hex conversion 
code snippit from:
(https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-convert-from-decimal-to-hexadecimal-in-C-language).
