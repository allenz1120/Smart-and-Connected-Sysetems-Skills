## Summary
This program completes all the tasks required in skill 28. The fob is able to communicate to multiple FOBs and elect a leader with the lowest ID number using a bully algorithm. The program can also elect a new leader if the the current leader is "broken" or disconnected. It will also restart a leader election when a new FOB is added into the election even if the election has already started. During the election, the LED will be green. If a FOB realizes it is not a leader, its LED will turn red and if at the end of the election, the last FOB with a green led will turn blue for leader.
